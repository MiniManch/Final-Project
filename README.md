# Fix Us 

This is the final project of my Full Stack Development bootcamp!

## About
In this Project, I've used HTML,CSS JS on the base of a Flask application, alongside front and backend libraries, and the use of external API's to create a DIY Guide forum and store, where users can Create Guides, for other users to use to fix anything and everything! they can also post a 'broken' item on the store and link a guide that explains step by step, how to fix it ,and what tools are needed inorder to do that.
